# OTxplorer-R

**OTxplorer-R** is an interactive R Shiny app and package that helps researchers explore relationships between drug targets, diseases, and drugs using data from the [Open Targets Platform](https://platform.opentargets.org/).

## ðŸš€ Features
- Fetches targetâ€“diseaseâ€“drug associations via Open Targets GraphQL API  
- Visualizes relationships as interactive networks (visNetwork, igraph)  
- Supports search, filtering, and custom gene list uploads  
- Evidence-based graph exploration for target discovery  

## Installation
- To test and run OTxplorer-R, we recommend installing and activating a Conda environment using:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate otxplorer-r
```
